<p style="text-align: justify;">The experiment you are about to begin allows you to understand and verify the effects of the <strong><em>force of elasticity</em></strong> on bodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This force was studied, among the first, by <em>Robert <strong>Hooke</strong></em>, a physicist, a biologist, a geologist and, also, a British architect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robert was one of the most important scientists of the 1600s and one of the main figures  of the scientific revolution in England. He is remembered, precisely, for the formulation of the physical law on the force of elasticity, which bears his name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong><em>Hooke's law </em></strong> is the simplest expression that describes the behavior of elastic materials and can be very well explained by the elongation of a spring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The deformation x [mm] of the spring is directly proportional to the applied force of elasticity F [N], through a constant of proportionality so called stiffness k [N/mm], which depends on the nature of the spring:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>F = k&nbsp;x</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the scientific tool at your disposal, you have the opportunity to test different types of springs (extension and compression) and in different configurations (individually, in series, in parallel, in a combination of the previous ones).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Springs are different with each the other. You will find out by trying to place one or more small weights in the bowl and observing the different deformations of the springs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Now is up to you!</em></p>
